![Screenshot 2025-04-09 233842](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591d8209-a37b-42d6-9110-f9bb6153eed4)

A lightweight web application that detects knives and similar sharp objects in images using **TensorFlow.js** and the **MobileNet** model. 

## 🧠 About the Project

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained **MobileNet** model with **TensorFlow.js** to perform image classification directly in the browser. By uploading an image, the model attempts to identify the presence of knives.

> ✅ No need to install Python, TensorFlow, or any heavy backend — everything runs in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Upload an image and classify it instantly
- 🧠 Uses TensorFlow.js with the MobileNet model
- ⚡ Fast, client-side image processing
- 📱 Mobile-friendly and responsive UI
- 💡 Easy to deploy — no server needed!

---

🧪 How It Works
The app loads the MobileNet model using TensorFlow.js.

When an image is uploaded, the model performs classification.

Top predictions (with confidence scores) are displayed instantly.

Everything runs in the browser — no external API or model training is required.
